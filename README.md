# CommonGames App

"Let's play something, what games we have in common?" I've been asked too many times. Probably it's fine to go through everyones steam profile and try to spot something in common, with co-op or multiplayer support. 

"Let's write an app for that", I thought. So that is what I did... atleast partially.

## Frontend

React + Chakra

## Setup

- Clone repo && cd repo
- run ``npm install``
- Set env variables, see ``env.example``
- Run ``npm start``

Note: backend repo includes build-folder for the frontend as whole app is (for now) hosted at heroku, see it's repo [here](https://github.com/tatuhammaren/commongames-be)
